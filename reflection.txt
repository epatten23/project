Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
I have learned how to code with functions before, but this class really showed the importance of using functions and how it makes coding
larger and more intricate projects a lot easier. I think the first time it really hit me the importance and simplicity of functions was week
3 when we created random sentences. A couple years ago I tried to create a madlibs that would fill when the program ran. It took a lot
more lines of code than it should've, because I didn't understand how to use functions. Looking back on this experience, I see the value
in constantly using functions because of their versitility and effective nature.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
I'm definetly more of a trial and error kinda person, so learning about test functions and test programs was hard for me to get used to, but
now that I understand that they're used for larger projects to make sure they don't fail, it makes more sense. In my judgement, test functions
are useful for projects which are to be implemented on a larger scale. Having this test ensures that the project will not fail before it goes
out for final testing. It is able to test a single function rather than the whole program to help identify the source of the problem.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
Usually I don't realize my code has a bug until I run it at the very end. I could improve this by adding in test funcitons before I run my
final code. I could also utilize the debugging feature more than I have been. It's super helpful to identify exactly where the code is messing 
up, but I tend to just run it all and debug line by line rather than utilizing the debug function to identify it for me.
